# AGRICONNECT
Our smart agriculture website helps farmers detect crop pests and diseases early and provides preventive and curative control measures. It suggests suitable medicines, connects farmers to nearby agri-medicine shops via Google Maps, offers toll-free helpline support, and enables contact with volunteers to reduce crop loss and improve yield.
